	  <h2 class="enhancement">Describing the interaction and what a programmer has to do to implement the feature.</h2>
	  <p class="featurepara">I went through different websites and searched for different animation effects using javascript, Went through different codes and tried to understand the implementation of the effects.<br>
	  I also watched differnt YouTube videos to find the best enhancement suitable for my assignment and how will it look after the implementation. <br> I faced some errors while implementing them and also made extra changes to the already existing animation codes of JS on internet according to my needs.<br> I have sited the reference to websites and links
  I followed to implement my enhancement. It sometimes was quite frustrating when you find errors but are unable to resolve them , You need to think alot. <br> Honestly I learnt quite many things from this assignment and now I feel a little confident in this unit.</p> 	  
	  
	  
	  <h2 class="enhancement">Improvements made from Assignment 1</h2>
	  <ol>
	  <li>Our Respected Tutor Bo Li commented that background colour/image of my website can be more improved, So I changed background image.</li>
	  <li>He stated that website was looking kinda messy so I made it decent and nice, changed colour pattern & combination of navigation bar and footer of website.</li>
	  <li>He told that phone no. pattern in Enquiry page is incorrect, so made changes to that and improved enquiry page.</li>
	  </ol>

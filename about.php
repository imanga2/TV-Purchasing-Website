     <aside id="a">Besides trying my luck at several cultural competitions as the Co-Curricular Activity Incharge at high school,
	   I have also been to some national competitions in Roller-Skating and Roll-Ball and have been playing Basketball at the interschool level lately.
	   I love to dance and have been 1st runner up in Jammu's Rising Star Dance Contest held by Jammu Links News channel in 2017 and have participated 
	   in Jammu's Got Talent whose results are awaited due to Covid-19 pandemic. My area of interest also extends as far as singing and playing the guitar
	   that led me to create a YouTube Channel where I post my self-composed songs and dance videos.</aside>
       <aside id="a1">I also secured 3rd state rank in International French Language Olympiad (IFLO) conducted by Silverzone Foundation in 2015, as French was my optional subject till grade 8.
	   I have even participated in various inter-school debates and declamation competitions. 
       My subjects of interest are also mostly related to the topics of Astral World, Time Travel, Extra-Terrestrials, Universe facts, and Quantum Physics. 
	   I also extend my interest in music and video editing and have quite good experience in it.</aside>

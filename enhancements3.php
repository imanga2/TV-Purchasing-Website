       <h2 class="enhancement">Describing the interaction and what a programmer has to do to implement the feature.</h2>
	  <p class="featurepara">I went through different websites, Went through different codes and tried to understand the implementation of the PHP codes.<br>
	  I also watched differnt YouTube videos to find the best enhancement suitable for my assignment and how will it look after the implementation. <br> I faced some errors while implementing them.<br>. It sometimes was quite frustrating when you find errors but are unable to resolve them , You need to think alot. <br> Honestly I learnt quite many things from this assignment and now I feel a little confident in this unit.</p>
